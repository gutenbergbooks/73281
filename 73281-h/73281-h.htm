<h3>
Preface<br>
</h3>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> attentive reader of Shakespeare’s Poems
and Plays can hardly fail to notice the
remarkable frequency of the Poet’s allusions
to Birds, not merely as a great Choir
of songsters, enlivening the woods and
fields With their varied music, but as
individual creatures, each endowed with its
own special characters. Shakespeare has
drawn an assemblage of bird-portraits to
which, for extent and variety, no equal is
to be found in any other great English
poet. Making ample use of what he had
himself observed about Birds in their native
haunts, and combining this personal knowledge
with what he could obtain from
literature and from popular fancy or superstition,
he has employed the material thus
gathered to illustrate, in many an apt simile
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_vi">[Pg vi]</span>
and striking metaphor, his vivid presentation
of the great drama of human life. If
we compare him in this respect with
either the poets who preceded or those
who have followed him we learn that he
stands apart from them all.</p>

<p>The present little volume was written as
a Presidential Address to the Haslemere
Natural History Society, and was read to
the members on March 9th of the present
year. The approach of the Shakespeare
Tercentenary having brought the poet and
his writings more closely to the mind, it
appeared to me not inappropriate that a
company of naturalists should be asked to
consider how one branch of the subjects in
which they are more specially interested
had been treated by the greatest poet of
all time. The Address was nearly finished
when I came, for the first time, upon the
excellent and exhaustive <cite>Ornithology of
Shakespeare</cite>, by Mr. James Harting, published
in 1871. I would gladly have
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_vii">[Pg vii]</span>
availed myself of this volume had I known
of it sooner, but I gleaned from it a few
quotations which in my search through
the Poems and Plays I had missed. My
object, however, was somewhat different
from that author’s. Approaching the
subject from the literary rather than the
scientific side, I desired to show that
Shakespeare’s delight in birds and bird-music
was not less keen than that of
Chaucer and the earlier poets, and at the
same time to point out how detailed was
his acquaintance with birds, and how wide
the range of similitudes which he drew
from them to the great enrichment of
our literature. I have ventured also to
illustrate the change of poetic mood since
his time in regard to Nature by citing
three poems on Birds by three of the great
poets of last century.</p>

<p>The <cite>Cambridge Shakespeare</cite> of W. Aldis
Wright is the text from which my citations
are made. I have to thank Messrs.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_viii">[Pg viii]</span>
Gurney and Jackson for their courtesy in
supplying some clichés taken from the
illustrations in the useful <cite>Manual of British
Birds</cite> by my friend the late Mr. Howard
Saunders, in which the text-figures are so
faithful and at the same time artistic.</p>

<p>In all humility I desire to lay this little
Tercentenary offering at the shrine of the
“Sweet Swan of Avon.”</p>

<h3>
The Birds of Shakespeare<br>
</h3>
</div>


<p class="drop-cap">F<span class="smcap">rom</span> the infancy of mankind no tribe
of living creatures has awakened
more sympathy in the human heart than
the Birds of the Air. Their pairing, their
nesting, their sedulous care of their young,
their arrival in spring and disappearance in
autumn, the endless variety of their notes,
and the manifold diversity of their habits
and dispositions, often so suggestive of
analogies with those of human nature,
have arrested the attention of even the
most unobservant men. This wide range
of attraction, appealing so directly to the
poetic instincts of humanity, has called
forth hearty recognition in the literature
of every age and of every tongue. In our
own literature this recognition has been
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_2">[Pg 2]</span>
more especially ample. Chaucer, the illustrious
Father of English Poetry, struck the
keynote of that passionate love of Nature
which has been maintained among us
with ever-growing devotion. “Nature,
the vicar of the Almighty Lord,” to use
his own expression, filled his soul with a
deep, reverential and joyous delight in the
endless beauty and charm of the outer
world. This pleasure included an ardent
appreciation of bird-life, which finds vent
continually in simple but enthusiastic language
all through his writings. Chaucer
was undoubtedly a bookish man, much
attached to his favourite authors and to
meditation upon them. Yet, as he himself
confesses, there were times when the
open country, with all its varied sights and
sounds, and especially with its exuberant
life in plants and animals, had for him
even greater attraction. He tells that</p>

</div>

<p class="unindent">In his vivid descriptions of scenes in spring
and summer, the carols of the birds are
always a prominent feature. Thus, at the
very beginning of his <cite>Canterbury Tales</cite>, the
mere thought of April, with its sweet
showers and tender leafage “in every bolt
and heath,” recalls to him how the</p>

</div>

<p class="unindent">His poem on <cite>The Parlement of Foules</cite>
represents the various birds of the air
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_4">[Pg 4]</span>
coming in a crowded throng from all
quarters to choose their mates. As he
enumerates our familiar birds he couples
with their names epithets that express the
popular estimation of them. The scene
is laid in a garden where</p>

</div>
</div>

<p class="unindent">Again, in his quaint and humorous verses
on the <cite>Cuckow and the Nightingale</cite>, the
poet transports us into the very heart
of the woods to hear a discourse between
these two harbingers of summer. For the
nightingale he had a fondness which is
lovingly expressed in the <cite>Flower and the
Leaf</cite>, where we find the picture of a
woodland of oaks whose new leaves</p>

</div>
</div>

<p>This simple delight in the voices of the
birds, so prominent in the poems of the
author of the <cite>Canterbury Tales</cite>, was maintained
among his successors in English
poetry. By Elizabethan times, however,
it had become enlarged and enriched by
the growth of a more observant and contemplative
habit. The spontaneous and
irresistible joy of the human soul in the
varied beauty of Nature, and not least in
the bird-music of the fields and woods, is as
marked in Shakespeare’s works as it was in
those of Chaucer; but it is now combined
with more thought and reflection. The appreciation
of life in all its divers forms has
grown closer, more sympathetic and more
intimately linked with human experience.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>Surroundings of his Boyhood</i></div>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</span>
Shakespeare had the good fortune to be
born in one of the pleasantest and most
varied districts of England, in the midst of
fields and gardens, as well as wide tracts of
woodland and heath, among sturdy farmer-folk,
and simple peasantry. The face of
open Nature lay spread out around him,
and his earliest poems bear witness to the
range and acuteness of his faculty of
observation amid the fields and forests, the
beasts and birds of his home. The extent
and accuracy of his acquaintance with law
have been claimed as proof that he had
passed through some legal training. There
is sounder evidence that his remarkable
familiarity with objects of natural history
could not have been derived at secondhand
from books, but was acquired from
his own personal observation. His youthful
surroundings in Warwickshire furnished
him with ample opportunity of acquiring
and cultivating this knowledge. Nor
should it be forgotten that the London in
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</span>
which he spent the active years of his
middle life, was a comparatively small
town. Open country lay within a short
walking distance from any part of it.
Heaths and woodlands, with all their riches
of animal life, extended almost up to its
outskirts. So that even in the height of
his busy theatrical career the dramatist
could easily, at any interval of leisure,
renew his acquaintance with the face of
Nature which he dearly loved.</p>

<p>An attentive study of Shakespeare’s
dramas supplies probable indications of
some of his early observations among
natural history objects. When, for instance,
he makes Benedick assert that
Claudio had committed</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p class="unindent">the flat transgression of a school-boy, who, being
overjoyed with finding a bird’s nest, shows it his
companion, and he steals it,<a id="FNanchor_5" href="#Footnote_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a></p>
</div>

<p class="unindent">he probably could remember incidents of
that kind among the boys at the grammar
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</span>
school of Stratford. At all events, that
he himself had known the excitements of
bird-nesting may be fairly inferred from
the following passage:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
    <div class="verse indent0">Unreasonable creatures feed their young;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And though man’s face be fearful to their eyes,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Yet, in protection of their tender ones,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Who hath not seen them, even with those wings</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Which sometime they have used with fearful flight,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Make war with him that climb’d unto their nest,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Offering their own lives in their young’s defence?<a id="FNanchor_6" href="#Footnote_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a></div>
</div>
</div>

<p>As a concomitant of his love of outdoor
life it was natural and almost inevitable
that the future dramatist should become a
sportsman. There does not appear to be
any good reason to question the truth of
the tradition that in his youth he joined
his Stratford companions in poaching Sir
Thomas Lucy’s deer in Charlecote Park.
When he wrote the following lines we can
well imagine that he had some of his own
escapades in mind:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
    <div class="verse indent0">What, hast not thou full often struck a doe,</div>

<div class="sidenote"><i>Bird-Capture</i></div>

<p>Both the Poems and the Plays show him
to have been well-versed in all the arts
then in vogue for the capture of birds
dead or alive—the use of bird-lime for the
smaller kinds, the fixing of springes and
gins, the spreading of nets, the employment
of decoys in the shape of caged birds
or of painted fruit and flowers, as well
as the ordinary weapons for shooting—birding-pieces,
bows and arrows, and crossbows
and bolts. More especially does he
appear to have mastered the whole craft
of falconry, then so much in vogue; for
his writings are full of the vocabulary of
its technical terms. The frequency and
detail of the poet’s allusions to the various
methods of bird-capture suggest the
experience of one who speaks from
personal practice. He is fond of introducing
these allusions in illustration of the
plots and wiles of man with regard to his
fellow-men. So many of these methods
of capture have gone out of fashion that
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</span>
the modern reader is apt to be surprised at
the constant recurrence of references to
them in Shakespeare’s writings, and to
forget how much more they would appeal
to the imagination in the days of Elizabeth
than they can do now. A few illustrations
may be quoted here. Thus Lady
Macduff, musing on the future of her
little son, but all unsuspicious of the fate
immediately impending on him, tells him</p>

<div class="poetry-container">

<p>The supposed experience of a bird that
has once been nearly caught is transferred
by the poet to the human heart. King
Henry <abbr title="Six">VI.</abbr> laments his fate in this wise:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
    <div class="verse indent0">The bird that hath been limed in a bush,</div>

</div>
</div>

<p>On the other hand, the innocent assurance
of a blameless soul is likened to that
of a bird that has never known the
treacherous arts of the fowler.</p>

<div class="poetry-container">

</p>

<p>But it is from the sport of falconry that
Shakespeare draws most frequently his
allusions to bird-capture. Some of these
I shall quote in connection with his
references to hawks and hawking. The
poet does not confine his similes to birds
in the wild state, but draws them also with
effect from birds in confinement, as where
he represents King Henry <abbr title="Six">VI.</abbr> thanking
the Lieutenant of the Tower for courtesy
shown to him during his imprisonment:</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>His feeling for Nature</i></div>

<p>It will be remembered, also, how touchingly
the same comparison appears in the
scene wherein Cordelia and Lear are led
off the stage guarded. When she asks

daughters and these sisters?” Lear impatiently
answers,</p>

</div>

<p>Shakespeare’s feeling for Nature and love
of outdoor life are nowhere more fully and
admirably expressed than in his delightful
Play of <cite>As You Like It</cite>. Pervaded by the
very breath of the country and the charms
of rural life and sylvan peace, the chief
scenes of this drama are laid in a landscape
that was doubtless based on recollections
of his youthful home, and he appropriately
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</span>
named it after his own “Forest of Arden”
in Warwickshire. He transports us to a
green woodland, interspersed with copses
of hawthorns and brambles, revealing
grassy glades among venerable trees, where
flocks of sheep and goats are pasturing,
while here and there we catch sight of a
quiet herd of deer. We meet, too, with
shepherds and foresters, and come upon a
cottage near the rank osiers by a murmuring
stream. Now and then our attention
is drawn to some specially picturesque
feature in the timber of the forest, such as
“an oak whose antique root peeps out
upon the brook that brawls along the
wood.”<a id="FNanchor_18" href="#Footnote_18" class="fnanchor">[18]</a> Or we are halted</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
    <div class="verse indent0">Under an oak, whose boughs were moss’d with age,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And high top bald with dry antiquity.<a id="FNanchor_19" href="#Footnote_19" class="fnanchor">[19]</a></div>
</div>

<p class="unindent">And there are smooth-stemmed beech-trees,

<div class="sidenote"><i>His picture of English Landscape</i></div>
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</span>

<p>Into this essentially English scenery
the poet introduces a fence of olive-trees
around the sheep-cote, likewise “a green
and gilded snake,” together with a
“hungry lioness” that lies crouching on
the ground, ready to spring upon a man
when he awakes from sleep. But these
productions of other climes were, from the
dramatist’s point of view, no more out of
place in his forest, than was the presence
of a banished duke with his company of
lords and attendants. He had created an
ideal landscape out of his own Forest of
Arden, and he might clothe it with such
vegetation and people it with such beings
as he thought that the claims of his art
allowed.</p>

<p>Among the first sounds that greet our
ears after we enter this land of enchantment
are those of an invitation to hear
the bird-music:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
    <div class="verse indent0">Under the greenwood tree</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Who loves to lie with me,</div>

    <div class="verse indent12">Here shall he see</div>

    <div class="verse indent0">But winter and rough weather.<a id="FNanchor_20" href="#Footnote_20" class="fnanchor">[20]</a></div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="unindent">And in nearly the last strains that reach
us before the drama closes, the carol of
the birds comes in again:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
    <div class="verse indent2">In the spring time, the only pretty ring time,</div>

</div>
</div>

<p>It will be remembered that the contemplation
of the woodland peace and
happiness of the Forest of Arden inspired
the poet with one of the most pregnant
passages to be found in his works. Though
the quotation has become rather hackneyed
from constant use, it deserves to be
treasured in the heart of everyone to whom
the study of Nature is dear:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">

<div class="sidenote"><i>His Sympathy with Life</i></div>

<p>In this pastoral drama, and throughout
his Poems and Plays, Shakespeare manifests
the keen pleasure with which the face of
Nature filled his soul. The beauty and
fragrancy of flowers and woods, the movements
and music of birds were a joy to
him. But he combined with this enjoyment
a feeling of pity for the frailty and
suffering of living things. A recent and
most able writer on Shakespeare has stated
as his opinion that “the wild creatures of
the fields and woods, because they have
never run the risk of familiarity with man,
are outside the circle of Shakespeare’s
sympathetic observation.” I venture to
think that a more mistaken judgement
could hardly have been pronounced.
Shakespeare was not a man of science, but
he obviously had some of the best qualities
of a naturalist—quickness and accuracy of
eye and sympathy with life, not of man
only, but of every creature that lives and
feels. This sympathy shows itself in his
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</span>
allusions to birds, but is displayed also in
his references to animals both higher and
lower in the scale of being, which “have
never run the risk of familiarity with
man.” In the remarkable Play which we
have just been considering it is conspicuously
prominent. The banished Duke in
the Forest of Arden asks his companions
if they will go with him to kill some
venison, but before their answer comes, he
immediately adds, on reflection:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
    <div class="verse indent0">And yet it irks me the poor dappled fools,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Being native burghers of this desert city,</div>

    <div class="verse indent0">Have their round haunches gored.<a id="FNanchor_23" href="#Footnote_23" class="fnanchor">[23]</a></div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="unindent">This commiseration is expressed much
more forcibly by one of his “co-mates
and brothers in exile,” the melancholy

languish at the same spot. As he watched

<p>The poet’s feeling of pity descends even
to small and fragile forms of living things,
to which most people are indifferent or
even hostile. Perhaps he may sometimes
have credited these feeble creatures with
greater sensitiveness to pain than a modern
naturalist would allow, as where Isabella in

superb charger he tells how the animal
proudly “stamps and bites the poor flies
in his fume.”<a id="FNanchor_30" href="#Footnote_30" class="fnanchor">[30]</a> The most detailed and remarkable
expression of this commiseration

<p>The mind of Titus, broken down by a
succession of crushing calamities, had by
this time become unhinged, and the extravagance
of his language is doubtless
designed to show this derangement, though
it may perhaps also express the poet’s own
underlying pity with even “the poor harmless
fly.” Modern science, however, has
recently discovered that the house-fly is
far from harmless, and that its ruthless
extirpation from human habitations, as a
dangerous carrier of disease, should be
regarded as really what Titus called “a
charitable deed.”</p>

<p>Not less effectively than his forerunner
Chaucer, does Shakespeare enliven his
pictures of day and night and of the
seasons of the year by introducing the
voices of the birds. He loves the</p>

<p class="unindent">The movement of spring and the renewal
of the activity of the birds are well

<p class="unindent">Again, in a song from which I have just

<p>In many passages, to some of which I
shall presently allude, the poet heightens
the gloom of night by allusion to the
nocturnal birds which screech or moan in
the dark, or he lightens its eeriness with
the pensive melody of the nightingale.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</span>
Shakespeare was keenly alive to the
strong contrasts so continually placed in
juxtaposition by Nature—what he calls</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
    <div class="verse indent0">Melodious discord, heavenly tune harsh-sounding,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Ear’s deep-sweet music, and heart’s deep-sore wounding.<a id="FNanchor_39" href="#Footnote_39" class="fnanchor">[39]</a></div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="unindent">He recognised contrasts of this kind both
in the animate and the inanimate creation,
and not least where the birds are involved:</p>

The co-existence of pleasure and pain, of
joy and sorrow, met the poet even among the
tender creatures in whose songs he delighted.
He saw that the grief or suffering of one
single songster in no perceptible degree
quieted the carolling of the rest of the choir.</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
    <div class="verse indent0">All thy fellow-birds do sing,</div>

<p class="unindent">He realised, as many another poet has also
found, that there are times in which the
joyous songs of birds may even sound
harshly to human ears when the heart is
bowed down with affliction. Thus he
wrote of Lucrece:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
    <div class="verse indent0">The little birds that tune their morning’s joy</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Make her moans mad with their sweet melody:</div>

    <div class="verse indent0">And in my hearing be you mute and dumb:</div>

While Shakespeare, like his poetical
predecessors and contemporaries, regarded
the whole tribe of birds as a great
vocal assemblage, a delightful section of
animated Nature, that gives life and charm
to the countryside, his Poems and Plays
stand apart for the remarkable extent to
which he singles out individual birds by
name, often with such detailed reference
to their habits as to show that he well
knew them in their native haunts. The
birds thus distinguished by him amount
to some fifty in number, as given in the
following list:</p>

<p class="unindent">Of a few of them he makes only a single
mention, but most of them are more
frequently cited, in some cases, indeed, as
often as forty or fifty times. Recognising
in these creatures traits that remind him
of the feelings and actions of mankind,
he makes varied and effective use of them
as symbols and illustrations with which
to enrich his vivid picture of the great
drama of human life. The naturalist,
interested in noting the attitude of the
greatest poet of all time towards living
creatures, feels no surprise that Shakespeare’s
knowledge of natural history is
sometimes inaccurate, or that he should
have taken on trust some of the fabulous
legends in that subject, which were
current in his day. The scientific study
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</span>
of Nature had not yet been seriously
undertaken.</p>

<p>I propose to enumerate here the birds
individually selected by Shakespeare for
special comment, and to cite a few passages
from his works in illustration of the various
ways in which he makes use of each
of them. It will be convenient to take
them in groups.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>The Eagle</i></div>
</div>
<p>We may begin with <span class="smcap">Birds of Prey</span>,
following the precedent set by Chaucer,
who in his long list tells that “the fowles
of ravine were hyest sette.” The <span class="allsmcap">EAGLE</span>
is cited some forty times. The two birds
of this kind native to Britain, the Golden
Eagle, and the White-tailed or Sea-eagle,
now so restricted in number, were doubtless
more abundant in his day. He may
have occasionally seen examples of each of
them on the wing, though his allusions
hardly suggest any personal familiarity
with the birds. Recognising the lofty
rank of the eagle and its acknowledged
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</span>
dignity above the other birds of prey, he
makes the birds themselves, in the arrangements
for the obsequies of the Phoenix
and Turtle, admit this supremacy.</p>

<p class="unindent">With delightful hyperbole, Biron, in <cite>Love’s

potency of “love first learned in a lady’s

<p>Shakespeare, when he likens the orders

<p class="unindent">Among Shakespeare’s political allusions in

portion was compared to a destructive
kind of vermin.</p>

<p>Shakespeare’s acquaintance with the
family of <span class="allsmcap">HAWKS</span> was manifestly of the
most intimate kind. These birds were
common natives of the country, and in
great request for the sport of falconry.
His writings prove him to have had a
detailed knowledge of the terminology of
this sport, and he was probably himself a
keen falconer in his early years, if not
throughout his life. His Plays are full of
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</span>
the technical language of hawking, which
he employs by way of similitude in matters
of a wholly different nature. As an example
of this habit no better illustration
can be given than Petruchio’s description
of the method he meant to employ to
tame his ill-tempered wife. In the approved
lingo of the practical falconer he
remarks to himself:</p>

The extent to which falconry and its
language had taken hold of the society of
Elizabeth’s time is well illustrated in the
scene in Capulet’s garden where Romeo

attachment. She has twice retired, but
again returns to the window for one last

<p>Under the general designation of <span class="smcap">Hawks</span>
most of our larger birds of prey were employed

mainly with reference to this use of them

<span class="smcap">Falcon</span>, the name most frequently used by
him, may include several distinct species.<a id="FNanchor_64" href="#Footnote_64" class="fnanchor">[64]</a>

<p>The falcon generally employed in hawking

The <span class="smcap">buzzard</span> is mentioned several times
by Shakespeare, and always in a more or
less depreciatory sense. It is a large handsome
bird, but compared with the falcon
is slow and heavy in flight. So in the
encounter of wits between Petruchio and
Katharine, he in his characteristic falconer’s
language asks her:</p>

<p>In a passage already cited the buzzards
are coupled with the disreputable kites.
Professor Newton remarks that “in the old
days of falconry, buzzards were regarded
with infinite scorn, and hence in common
English to call a man a ‘buzzard’ is to
denounce him as stupid.”<a id="FNanchor_71" href="#Footnote_71" class="fnanchor">[71]</a>

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</span>
In the time of Elizabeth the <span class="smcap">kite</span> (or
<i>Puttock</i>), now one of the rarest of our
birds, was quite common in this country.
It was particularly abundant in London,
where it fed on the garbage of the streets,
and even of the Thames, and where,
together with the raven, it was protected
by law as a useful scavenger without pay.
The frequency of Shakespeare’s allusions
to this bird is good evidence of how
familiar it must then have been. It is
always referred to in some disparaging
way. The “hungry kite” did not scruple
to carry off any living creature it could
overcome even from the very farm-yard.
When Warwick mentions to the Queen
his suspicions of foul play in Duke
Humphrey’s death, he tells her:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
    <div class="verse indent0">Who finds the partridge in the puttock’s nest</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">But may imagine how the bird was dead,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Although the kite soar with unbloodied beak?</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Even so suspicious is this tragedy.<a id="FNanchor_72" href="#Footnote_72" class="fnanchor">[72]</a></div>
</div>
</div>

<p>In an earlier part of the same Play York
asks:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
    <div class="verse indent0">Were’t not all one, an empty eagle were set</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">To guard the chicken from a hungry kite,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">As place Duke Humphrey for the King’s protector?</div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="unindent"><span class="pagenum" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</span>
to which the Queen replies:—“So the
poor chicken should be sure of death.”<a id="FNanchor_73" href="#Footnote_73" class="fnanchor">[73]</a>
In <cite>Winter’s Tale</cite>, when Antigonus is sent
on his task to carry the child to some
distant desolate spot, he takes it up,
saying:

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
    <div class="verse indent24">Come on, poor babe:</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Some powerful spirit instruct the kites and ravens</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">To be thy nurses! Wolves and bears, they say,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Casting their savageness aside, have done</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Like offices of pity.<a id="FNanchor_74" href="#Footnote_74" class="fnanchor">[74]</a></div>
</div>
</div>

<p>But it was more especially as feeders on
carrion or on weakly animals that the kites
were held in disrepute. Cassius, before
the battle of Philippi, recognises the forerunners
of carnage in the foul birds that
hovered above him:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">

    <div class="verse indent18">Ravens, crows and kites</div>

    <div class="verse indent0">Our army lies, ready to give up the ghost.<a id="FNanchor_75" href="#Footnote_75" class="fnanchor">[75]</a></div>
</div>

    <div class="verse indent0">Even of the bonny beast he loved so well.<a id="FNanchor_76" href="#Footnote_76" class="fnanchor">[76]</a></div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="unindent">The thievish propensities of the kite when
building its nest led it to plunder all sorts
of garments that might be bleaching on
the hedge,—pieces of rag, old hats, and
bits of paper. This habit is sympathetically
referred to by Autolycus, who was
himself, as he confesses, another “snapper-up
of unconsidered trifles.”—“My traffic
is sheets; when the kite builds, look to
lesser linen.”<a id="FNanchor_77" href="#Footnote_77" class="fnanchor">[77]</a> The very name of kite
became an epithet of contempt and hatred.
When Goneril announced to her father in
peremptory terms that he must “disquantity
his train,” poor old Lear’s indignation
was in response hurled at her in these
words, “Detested kite.”<a id="FNanchor_78" href="#Footnote_78" class="fnanchor">[78]</a></p>

The <span class="smcap">osprey</span>, now almost extirpated as a
native of these islands, was probably not
uncommon in the time of Elizabeth. It is
once mentioned by Shakespeare. Aufidius,
the General of the Volscians, alluding to
the regard of the Roman people for the
banished Coriolanus, reluctantly confesses:</p>

<p class="unindent">It would almost seem that the poet had

<p>The <span class="smcap">vulture</span>, not infrequently mentioned
by Shakespeare, is not a British
bird, though at rare intervals it has appeared
as a migrant in this country. The poet
most likely never saw one, his allusions to it
being obviously based on its reputation for
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</span>
voracity, and partly also on the legend of
Prometheus and the eagle. In one passage
a speaker asserts “there cannot be that vulture
in you to devour so many.”<a id="FNanchor_80" href="#Footnote_80" class="fnanchor">[80]</a> The expressions
“vulture thought” and “vulture
folly” are used in the Poems.<a id="FNanchor_81" href="#Footnote_81" class="fnanchor">[81]</a> A favourite
observation of the braggart Pistol was “let
vultures vile seize on his lungs.” Sir
William Lucy speaks of “the vulture of
sedition that feeds in the bosom of great
commanders.”<a id="FNanchor_82" href="#Footnote_82" class="fnanchor">[82]</a> “The gnawing vulture
of the mind” is referred to in <cite>Titus
Andronicus</cite>. But the most touching allusion
in which this bird is used is that
where King Lear, wounded to the quick

<p>Reference may be made to two other
exotic birds mentioned by Shakespeare—the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</span>
Parrot and the Ostrich. As one result
of the many voyages of discovery in his
day, both in the Old and the New World,
the <span class="allsmcap">PARROT</span> had become a familiar bird in
England. Its loud and harsh clamour,
its docility, its clever imitation of human
speech, but at the best, the paucity of
its vocabulary, are duly noted by our
dramatist. In one scene we are told how
Falstaff was pleased to have “his poll
clawed like a parrot,”<a id="FNanchor_84" href="#Footnote_84" class="fnanchor">[84]</a> in another, a lady
declares that in her jealousy she will be
“more clamorous than a parrot against

the drawer at the Boar’s Head Tavern in
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</span>
Eastcheap who had only two words of
reply to any call, and of who the merry
Prince remarked, with a sly hit at the fair
sex: “That ever this fellow should have
fewer words than a parrot, and yet the son
of a woman!”<a id="FNanchor_88" href="#Footnote_88" class="fnanchor">[88]</a> The parrot was also
known by the name of popinjay, a word
sometimes applied to a foppish dandy.
It is used in this sense by Hotspur with
reference to</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
    <div class="verse indent8">A certain lord, neat and trimly dress’d</div>

<p>The same word was used of the stuffed
bird or other mark set up to be shot at in
a competition of marksmanship. This
kind of sport in archery continues to be
kept up in Scotland, or was only recently
abandoned. It has been described by
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</span>
Scott in <cite>Old Mortality</cite>. I have myself
attended the summer festival of the
“Papingo” at Kilwinning where it is said

stuffed bird is there suspended from the
end of a pole fastened on the steeple at a
height of 100 feet from the ground.</p>

<p>The <span class="allsmcap">OSTRICH</span> or <span class="allsmcap">ESTRIDGE</span> was doubtless
an unfamiliar bird in England in the reign

<p>Three large water-birds, the Cormorant,

along all our rocky shores, was
described by Chaucer as “full of glotonye,”
and by the dramatist as the symbol of a
rapacious voracity. Thus, vanity is described
as an “insatiate cormorant”; we

of the “cormorant belly” and of</p>

<p>The word “Loon” or “Lown” is
employed by the poet to denote a rogue
or low fellow. A messenger of evil tidings
is called by Macbeth a “cream-faced
loon.”<a id="FNanchor_95" href="#Footnote_95" class="fnanchor">[95]</a> In the play of <cite>Pericles</cite> we hear
of a company that would include “both

<p>The name of Loon or Loom is a popular
appellation which includes three distinct
families of water-birds, all remarkable for
their clumsy gait on land. Whether this
name was applied to them after it had
first been in use as an uncomplimentary
epithet for a man, or was originally their
own common designation which came
eventually to acquire a human application,
remains in doubt. More probably the
bird was first owner, and the word may
belong to the group of bird-names like
goose, snipe, kite, hawk and others which
have become disparaging epithets for
human subjects. In Lincolnshire the
word is in use as the common name of
the Great Crested Grebe. Though now
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</span>

of night by introducing the remarkable
sound of the owl’s voice, and most
effectively when some deed of villainy is
on foot, or as one of the signs popularly
supposed to portend coming disaster. He
includes the owl also in that fairy world
which he has made so real. It will be
enough to cite a few examples of these
different usages in his works.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_55">[Pg 55]</span>
Traces are said still to linger in Gloucestershire
of a legend that had become
long ago attached to the owl, and which
was known to the great dramatist. He
makes use of it in the scene where
Ophelia appears distraught from her
father’s death. In her incoherent talk she
exclaims “they say the owl was a baker’s
daughter.”<a id="FNanchor_99" href="#Footnote_99" class="fnanchor">[99]</a> The tradition ran that our
Lord one day entered a baker’s shop and
asked for bread, which was grudgingly
and sparingly given by the baker’s
daughter who was thereupon turned by
Christ into an owl. There has long been
a popular feeling that something specially
uncanny and mysterious hangs about this
bird.</p>

<p class="unindent">The appearance of the owl by day was
unusual enough to be considered an evil

was reported that</p>

<p>The hooting or screeching of the owl

<p>Even at a babe’s nativity the sound of
this bird’s note might be taken as a bad

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_59">[Pg 59]</span>
Among its mysterious relationships, the
owl was believed to be connected with
some of the machinations of witchcraft.
It will be remembered that the miscellaneous
ingredients which went to the
making of the hell-broth of Macbeth’s
“midnight hags” included “a lizard’s leg
and howlet’s wing.”<a id="FNanchor_111" href="#Footnote_111" class="fnanchor">[111]</a></p>

<p>Shakespeare’s introduction of the owl
into his fairy-land was a dexterous artistic
stroke, for it connected a well-known
but somewhat mysterious bird
with his world of sprites, and gave to
that world a further touch of realism.
Alike in the <cite>Tempest</cite> and the <cite>Merry
Wives</cite> this conjunction may be seen.
The “dainty Ariel,” Prospero’s “tricksy
spirit,” sings:</p>

<p>In Bottom’s song in <cite>Midsummer Night’s

Venice and re-enters her home, Lorenzo,
who is eagerly expecting her return, says

As might be anticipated, the birds
which are treated as game take their place
in the Shakespearian dramas, as well as
the birds of prey that hunted them. The
<span class="allsmcap">WOODCOCK</span>, for example, is referred to by
name nine times, generally in connection
with the gin or springe with which in
those days it was taken, and in reference
to some trick or contrivance by which
somebody is caught or deceived. When,
for instance, the Duke of York, seized by
Queen Margaret and her lords, struggles
to free himself from their hands, he is
taunted by two of the lords, who both
make use of the language of sport. Clifford
tells him:</p>

With pardonable exaggeration, Juliet, as
she stood alone in the orchard awaiting
her lover, gave vent thus to her longing:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
    <div class="verse indent0">Come, night; come, Romeo; come, thou day in night;</div>

<p>The blackness of this bird in contrast
to the pure whiteness of a dove, supplies
an image to Lysander, mistakenly bewitched
by the mischievous Puck:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">

<div class="sidenote"><i>The Raven</i></div>

<p>The Raven has long had the evil reputation
of not only killing the smaller wild
animals but, in common with the crows
and kites, of watching for and attacking
those of larger size that look enfeebled by
disease or accident. Thus we read that</p>

</div>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_71">[Pg 71]</span></p>

<p class="unindent">With less justice, the bird has also been
credited with savageness of disposition—a
character which Shakespeare has sometimes
attributed to persons who may outwardly
seem to be gentle and kindly. These
are said to have “a raven’s heart within a
dove.”<a id="FNanchor_139" href="#Footnote_139" class="fnanchor">[139]</a> Juliet expands the simile—</p>

<p class="unindent">Yet there was a belief that the Raven can
show a wholly different nature:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">

    <div class="verse indent0">The whilst their own birds famish in their nests.<a id="FNanchor_141" href="#Footnote_141" class="fnanchor">[141]</a></div>
</div>

<p>The Raven comes into one of the
Scriptural allusions in the Plays where
the faithful old Adam, pressing upon
Orlando the thrifty savings of his lifetime,
consoles himself with the prayer</p>

But the most frequent reference made by
Shakespeare to this bird has regard to
its supposed boding power. It is called
the “fatal raven.” A messenger of ill
news is said to “sing a raven’s note.”
When Othello has the first suspicions
craftily suggested to him by Iago, he
exclaims</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>The Chough</i></div>
</div>

<p>In Shakespeare’s day the <span class="allsmcap">CHOUGH</span> must
have been a much commoner bird in our
islands than it is now. At present it is
not known to breed on the south coast of
England further east than the cliffs of
Dorset. Three hundred years ago, however,
it seems to have been abundant about
the chalk headlands of Kent. That it
was a familiar English bird may be
inferred from various passages in our
poet’s writings. The most striking scene
depicted by him, wherein this bird plays
a conspicuous part, is his picture of Dover
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_75">[Pg 75]</span>
cliffs, drawn so vividly, as from an actual
visit to the place:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
    <div class="verse indent20">How fearful</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And dizzy ’tis to east one’s eyes so low!</div>

    <div class="verse indent0">Show scarce so gross as beetles: half way down</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Hangs one that gathers samphire, dreadful trade!</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Methinks he seems no bigger than his head:</div>

    <div class="verse indent0">Cannot be heard so high.<a id="FNanchor_150" href="#Footnote_150" class="fnanchor">[150]</a></div>
</div>
</div>

<p>It is interesting to notice that while
birds are here taken as a help to the eye
in estimating the height of the precipice
as seen from the summit, a bird is again
used as a guide to gauge the height as
seen from below:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
    <div class="verse indent0">Look up a-height; the shrill-gorged lark so far</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Cannot be seen or heard.<a id="FNanchor_151" href="#Footnote_151" class="fnanchor">[151]</a></div>
</div>
</div>

<p>The habits of the chough were not
unknown to the poet, since he chose the
bird as a symbol for a certain courtier of
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_76">[Pg 76]</span>
whom it was said that “it was a vice
to know him”:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

</div>

<p>The chough’s continuous and unmusical
chatter is more than once contemptuously
invoked to describe the talk of some men.
When Antonio in <cite>The Tempest</cite> tempts
Sebastian to assassinate the honest old
Counsellor Gonzalo, he speaks of</p>

cliff:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">

<p>The <span class="allsmcap">MAGPIE</span> or Maggot-pie has already
been alluded to. Macbeth associates it with
choughs and rocks as a prophet or discoverer
of evil. It is named by King Henry

know turtles from jays,”<a id="FNanchor_161" href="#Footnote_161" class="fnanchor">[161]</a> and where
Imogen affirmed, “Some jay of Italy hath

<p class="p2">The various <span class="smcap">Birds of the Farm-yard</span>
have received due attention from the great
dramatist. Chief among them, the cock
is frequently cited, especially as a recognised
chronometer of the morning hours,
for in Elizabethan days this mode of
indicating time had not gone out of
popular use. We all remember the unhappy
experience of the carrier in the
inn at Rochester “since the first cock.”<a id="FNanchor_164" href="#Footnote_164" class="fnanchor">[164]</a>
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_82">[Pg 82]</span>
We also recall how Capulet, bustling
among his household, gave them a three-fold
indication of the time:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
    <div class="verse indent0">Come, stir, stir, stir! the second cock hath crow’d,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The curfew-bell hath rung, ’tis three o’clock.<a id="FNanchor_165" href="#Footnote_165" class="fnanchor">[165]</a></div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="unindent">Shakespeare brings the cock’s shrill clarion
even into his fairyland, for Ariel’s song
breaks off at this signal:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
    <div class="verse indent0">Hark, hark! I hear</div>

<p>But the most detailed and impressive
reference to this familiar bird occurs in
the memorable scene on the platform
before the Castle of Elsinore. The ghost
had just appeared to Hamlet’s friends and</p>

<p>The <span class="allsmcap">GOOSE</span>, so frequently alluded to in
the Plays, usually appears there as the
recognised symbol of human stupidity and
cowardice. How far this character, if
really deserved by the bird, is the result
of domestication and association with man
for many centuries, is a question for
ornithological psychologists. There can
be no doubt that the wild-goose does not
deserve the reputation attributed to his
degenerate kinsman in the farm-yard.
Shakespeare was aware how active and
vigilant that bird was among the fens
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_84">[Pg 84]</span>
which it haunted. He refers to the sudden
uprise and flight of</p>

<p class="center">
The wild geese that the creeping fowler eye,<a id="FNanchor_168" href="#Footnote_168" class="fnanchor">[168]</a><br>

fowl to the larger waters, a fact known
even to Lear’s fool, who remarks:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>The <span class="allsmcap">SWAN</span>, perhaps in Shakespeare’s day
more abundant in this country than it is
now, was then regarded as a “Bird
Royal” which nobody could keep without
a licence from the Crown, and
provision for making a certain mark on
the bird’s bill to denote its ownership.
Our Sovereigns still maintain the Royal
Swans on the Thames, and the young
birds are regularly taken up in summer
to receive the mark. To this bird full recognition
has been paid by our dramatist.
He places it before us in its usual watery
domain, where its nest serves as a symbol
of Britain set in the midst of the sea, “like a
swan’s nest in a great pool.”<a id="FNanchor_172" href="#Footnote_172" class="fnanchor">[172]</a> He lets us see</p>

<p>The <span class="allsmcap">TURKEY-COCK</span>, introduced into Europe
from the New World in the early part of
the sixteenth century, had become quite
naturalised in the farm-yards of England
by the time of Elizabeth. It is several
times alluded to by Shakespeare, sometimes
as a symbol of conceited ostentation,
and also as an article of food. When
in <cite>King Henry <abbr title="Five">V.</abbr></cite> Gower sees Pistol
approaching, he exclaims to Fluellen
“Here he comes, swelling like a turkey-cock,”
to which the Welshman, who
had resolved to make the braggart eat
the leek, replies, “’Tis no matter for
his swellings nor his turkey-cocks.”<a id="FNanchor_181" href="#Footnote_181" class="fnanchor">[181]</a>
Not less appropriately is the comparison
used of Malvolio, who, as Maria said,
had been “yonder i’ the sun practising
behaviour to his own shadow this
half hour.” As the three concealed
onlookers watch him strutting down
the walk, talking to himself, they can

scarcely restrain themselves. Fabian entreats

<p>The <span class="allsmcap">DOVE</span> and the <span class="allsmcap">PIGEON</span> are often mentioned
in Shakespeare’s writings, without
any essential distinction being drawn
between them. Thus, we read in one
passage that “Venus yokes her silver
doves,”<a id="FNanchor_188" href="#Footnote_188" class="fnanchor">[188]</a> while in another place the birds
appear as “Venus’ pigeons.”<a id="FNanchor_189" href="#Footnote_189" class="fnanchor">[189]</a> Again, in
a less poetical sphere, they are even interchanged
as articles of food. On the one

“some pigeons” and any other “pretty

of Falstaff,<a id="FNanchor_190" href="#Footnote_190" class="fnanchor">[190]</a> and on the other hand, we note

that gentleman “a dish of doves.”<a id="FNanchor_191" href="#Footnote_191" class="fnanchor">[191]</a></p>

<p>The <span class="allsmcap">BLACKBIRD</span> or <span class="allsmcap">OUZEL</span>, depicted in
Bottom’s song as “so black of hue, with
orange-tawny bill,” though one of our
most melodious songsters, receives no
commendation from Shakespeare. It is
only once again mentioned by him, when
its name is used with a rather uncomplimentary
meaning. When Justice Shallow
enquires of his brother magistrate regarding
his god-daughter, Silence replies, “Alas, a
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_97">[Pg 97]</span>
black ousel, cousin Shallow.”<a id="FNanchor_205" href="#Footnote_205" class="fnanchor">[205]</a> It is a pity
that the old and distinctive name ouzel for
this bird has become obsolete, though it
may still be heard in use in Scotland. On
the other side of the Tweed, also, where so
many linguistic relics of the old alliance with
France still remain, the blackbird is likewise
known by its French name of merle,
while the common name of the thrush is
<cite>mavis</cite>, likewise from the French <i lang="fr">mauvis</i>.</p>

<p>The <span class="allsmcap">THRUSH</span> or <span class="allsmcap">THROSTLE</span>, another of
our most musical warblers, is cited
thrice by Shakespeare without any further
comment on his voice than the compliment
in Bottom’s <span class="lock">song—“with</span> his note
so true.” The bird comes into one of
Autolycus’ songs:</p>

Shakespeare seems to have had a special

way in which the bird places its nest, and
the social instinct which leads it to build

<div class="sidenote"><i>The Nightingale</i></div>
</div>
<p>I have reserved for the last place in the
list of Shakespeare’s birds his references
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_106">[Pg 106]</span>
to the <span class="allsmcap">NIGHTINGALE</span>. These are numerous
and may be divided into two groups. In
one of them the style is somewhat artificial
in tone, reflecting not the poet’s
own experience of the bird, but the
legendary interpretation of its song that
had been handed down from remote
antiquity. In the other group, the
nightingale takes its natural place as one
of our familiar English songsters. There
was a Greek myth that Philomela, the
daughter of an Attic King, after being
cruelly treated by her brother Tereus, was
compassionately changed by the gods into
a nightingale, and that thereafter she
spent her life among woods lamenting in
mournful notes the fate that had befallen
her. Her name came to be given to the
bird. Shakespeare, following this legend,
introduces the bird as Philomel into his
separate Poems and into the lyrics included
in his dramas. In the ordinary
dialogue of the Plays, however, dropping
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_107">[Pg 107]</span>
the Greek name and legend, he uses the
common English appellation of the bird,
and, like ancient and modern poets, speaks
of the bird as feminine, although it is the
male alone that sings.</p>

<p>Along with the ancient myth about
Philomela he intertwined another and
probably much more recent, but equally
unfounded belief that the nightingale,
when it sings, leans against a thorn that
pierces its breast. This combination of
ignorant fancies is most fully expressed in
the following passage:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
    <div class="verse indent0">Every thing did banish moan,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Save the nightingale alone:</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">She, poor bird, as all forlorn,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Lean’d her breast up-till a thorn,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And there sung the dolefull’st ditty,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">That to hear it was great pity:</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">‘Fie, fie, fie,’ now would she cry;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">‘Tereu, tereu!’ by and by;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">That to hear her so complain,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Scarce I could from tears refrain;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">For her griefs, so lively shown,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Made me think upon my own.<a id="FNanchor_230" href="#Footnote_230" class="fnanchor">[230]</a></div>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_108">[Pg 108]</span>
The same artificial note of sadness runs
through the other allusions to Philomel.
In <cite>Lucrece</cite> we read:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
    <div class="verse indent0">By this, lamenting Philomel had ended</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The well-tuned warble of her nightly sorrow.<a id="FNanchor_231" href="#Footnote_231" class="fnanchor">[231]</a></div>

<p class="unindent">Again in the <cite>Sonnets</cite>:</p>

any reference to the alleged mournfulness
of her music:</p>

<div class="break">
<div class="sidenote"><i>Progress of English Poetry</i></div>
</div>
<p>The lapse of two centuries from the
time of Chaucer witnessed a change in
the mood of English poetry in regard to
its treatment of birds. The simple and
unaffected joy in the voices of the grove,
so conspicuous in the poems of the author
of the <cite>Canterbury Tales</cite>, had not become
less, but it had been accompanied by
the growth of a more observant and contemplative
spirit. While bird-music was
as much appreciated as ever, a much wider
field of interest in the feathered tribes had
been entered upon. Greater familiarity
with bird-life had been attained, and much
more was known about the habits of birds.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_112">[Pg 112]</span>
Of this knowledge use was made by way
of simile and illustration in regard to
human life. How often and how vividly,
for instance, does Shakespeare, by means
of an analogy from the world of birds,
portray the depth of man’s feelings,—his
joy, his sorrow and his suffering!</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>Birds in later Poetry</i></div>

<p>The law of evolution, which has been
so supreme in the history of organised life
on the globe, does not leave the human
mind outside of its influence. If there
was proof of progress in poetic insight
between the days of Chaucer and those of
Shakespeare, we may expect to find on
examination that other two centuries did
not pass without leaving some evidence of
change in the tone of our poetry. To
test this inference, some typical examples
may be taken from the poetry of the
nineteenth century where it deals with
birds, for comparison with the quotations
which have been cited from our great
dramatist. The subject is obviously far
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_113">[Pg 113]</span>
too wide to be fully entered upon here;
but it may be briefly illustrated by selecting
three well-known poems by three of
the most illustrious of the English poets
of the nineteenth century—the “Ode to
the Cuckoo” of Wordsworth, the “Ode
to the Nightingale” of Keats, and the
“Ode to the Skylark” of Shelley.</p>

<p>Coming anew to these poems from a
prolonged perusal of Shakespeare, we are
first struck by the fact that although
so distinct from each other in thought
as well as in music, they are akin in
being not mere references to the birds,
but actual addresses to particular members
of the feathered tribes. In each
case the ode is no cold description, but
a monologue, glowing with appreciation
and love, and spoken as it were
directly to the subject itself. The birds
are recognised as, like ourselves, “travellers
between life and death.” Instead of being
regarded as “unreasonable,” that is, devoid
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_114">[Pg 114]</span>
of any reasoning faculty, and gifted only
with what is called “instinct,” they are
felt to be linked with us by the possession
of many qualities that are closely akin to
some of the purest virtues of humanity.
And they are acknowledged to be fellow-creatures,
partners with us in the great
mystery of life. They are communed
with as if man’s longings could be made
known to them, and as if they in turn
might be brought to feel the reality and
depth of his affectionate interest in them,
or even perhaps be induced to reveal to
him the secret of their careless happiness.
The poets in their mystic rapture idealise
these songsters until they almost seem
to cease to be corporeal beings. Thus
Wordsworth:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
    <div class="verse indent0">O Cuckoo! shall I call thee Bird,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Or but a wandering voice?</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">* &emsp; * &emsp; * &emsp; * &emsp; * &emsp; * &emsp; *</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Even yet thou art to me</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">No bird, but an invisible thing,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">A voice, a mystery.</div>
</div>
</div>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_115">[Pg 115]</span></p>
Shelley’s ethereal melody becomes even
more ecstatic in his address to the
Skylark:

<div class="sidenote"><i>Wordsworth, Shelley and Keats</i></div>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
    <div class="verse indent0">Hail to thee, blithe spirit—</div>

<p class="unindent">To the modern poet the voices of the

his Skylark:</p>

<div class="poetry">
    <div class="verse indent10">Sound of vernal showers</div>
    <div class="verse indent12">On the twinkling grass,</div>
    <div class="verse indent10">Rain-awakened flowers,—</div>
    <div class="verse indent12">All that ever was,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Joyous and clear and fresh,—thy music doth surpass.</div>
    <div class="verse indent10">* &emsp; * &emsp; * &emsp; * &emsp; * &emsp; * &emsp; *</div>
    <div class="verse indent10">Yet, if we could scorn</div>
    <div class="verse indent12">Hate and pride and fear,</div>
    <div class="verse indent10">If we were things born</div>
    <div class="verse indent12">Not to shed a tear,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">I know not how thy joy we ever should come near.</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Keats recognised the same joyous feeling
in his Nightingale:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
    <div class="verse indent0">’Tis not through envy of thy happy lot,
       <span class="pagenum" id="Page_116">[Pg 116]</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent2">But being too happy in thy happiness,—</div>
    <div class="verse indent4">That thou, light-winged Dryad of the trees,</div>
    <div class="verse indent10">In some melodious plot</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">Of beechen green, and shadows numberless,</div>
    <div class="verse indent4">Singest of summer in full-throated ease.</div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="unindent">Each poet seeks to interpret for himself
the meaning of the song of the bird and
the sources of its inspiration. To Wordsworth
the Cuckoo seems to be</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
    <div class="verse indent4">Babbling to the vale</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Of sunshine and of flowers.</div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="unindent">To Keats the Nightingale was singing of
“summer.” Shelley asks the Skylark:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
    <div class="verse indent8">What objects are the fountains</div>
    <div class="verse indent10">Of thy happy strain?</div>
    <div class="verse indent8">What fields, or waves, or mountains?</div>
    <div class="verse indent10">What shapes of sky or plain?</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">What love of thine own kind? What ignorance of pain?</div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="unindent">Again, to the poet’s ear the bird-music
awakens memories of the past. To Wordsworth
the notes of the Cuckoo brought
“a tale of visionary hours” in his boyhood
when, in his endeavour to set eyes upon
the bird, he would</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
    <div class="verse indent8">Often rove
      <span class="pagenum" id="Page_117">[Pg 117]</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Through woods and on the green;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And thou were still a hope, a love;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Still longed for, never seen.</div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="unindent">To Keats the vista unfolded of the past
reached far beyond his own time:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
    <div class="verse indent0">The voice I hear this passing night was heard</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">In ancient days by emperor and clown;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Perhaps the self-same song that found a path</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">Through the sad heart of Ruth, when sick for home,</div>
    <div class="verse indent4">She stood in tears amid the alien corn;</div>
    <div class="verse indent8">The same that oft-times hath</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">Charmed magic easements, opening on the foam</div>
    <div class="verse indent4">Of perilous seas, in faery lands forlorn.</div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="unindent">The modern poet finds in the varied notes
of the birds not the bodings and portents,
superstitiously associated in the olden time
with such cries as those of the raven and
the owl, but high and solemn thoughts of
death and the hereafter. Shelley wrote of
his Skylark:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
    <div class="verse indent12">Waking or asleep,</div>
    <div class="verse indent14">Thou of death must deem</div>
    <div class="verse indent12">Things more true and deep</div>
    <div class="verse indent14">Than we mortals dream,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Or how could thy notes flow in such a crystal stream?</div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="unindent"><span class="pagenum" id="Page_118">[Pg 118]</span>
And Keats found his heart attuned by the
voice of the Nightingale to the contemplation
of his own dissolution:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
    <div class="verse indent0">Darkling I listen; and for many a time</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">I have been half in love with easeful Death,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Call’d him soft names in many a mused rhyme,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">To take into the air my quiet breath;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Now more than ever seems it rich to die,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">To cease upon the midnight with no pain,</div>
    <div class="verse indent4">While thou art pouring forth thy soul abroad</div>
    <div class="verse indent8">In such an ecstasy!</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">Still wouldst thou sing, and I have ears in vain—</div>
    <div class="verse indent4">To thy high requiem become a sod.</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>What the future course of English
Poetry will be in this same domain
cannot be confidently predicted. Already,
after the lapse of another century since
the three poems appeared which we have
been considering, a certain change in the
poetic mood with regard to living Nature
can be more or less distinctly perceived.
With such a splendid past to contemplate,
we may be well assured that our Poetry
will continue to be radiant with sympathy
for all living things. The birds will not
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_119">[Pg 119]</span>
fail to retain their “pride of place” in
the affections of each generation of poets,
and their voices, in the future as in the
past, will abide with man as the source
of some of the purest pleasure that can
solace his heart.</p>

<p class="footnote">Before passing from the subject of hawks and hawking, I
should state that the sport is not yet wholly extinct in this
country, and that we have at least two extant memorials of
the time when it was a favourite pastime here. There is
still among our King’s Court officials a Hereditary Grand
Falconer, the office being held in the family of the Duke of
St. Albans. In old times, and for many generations, the
royal stud of hawks was kept at Charing Cross in buildings
that were known as The Mews. In the reign of Henry
<abbr title="Eight">VIII.</abbr> these mews were turned into stables for horses, but
the time-honoured name still clung to them. It became
customary to call by this name lanes flanked with stables, and
this practice has continued down to our own day. When
we speak of “mews,” however, it is always horses and never
hawks that come into our minds.</p>
